### Envelope models

`make` to compile

`makegrid` to run

You will be asked for the column depth of the helium layer and the magnetic field (set B=0 for accreting neutron stars)

`out/grid` has columns (y, T, F, y_photosphere)  sorted by F

`out/grid_sorty` has columns (y, T, F, y_photosphere)  sorted by y

`plot_prof.py`  plots the (y,T) profiles for different fluxes
